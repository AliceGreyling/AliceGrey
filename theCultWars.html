The Cult Wars Project is a complex project that expands across multiple forms <br>
of media, revolving around a fantasy world in which cults have taken over society.<br>
<br>
Originally started off as a Dungeons & Dragons campaign concept my freshman year of high school,<br> 
The Cult Wars Project is a fantasy world that I plan to expand into multiple forms of media<br>
such as animation, video games, graphic novels, and music. <br>
<br>
The Cult Wars Project has provided a great platform to practice writing, world planning, and character design.
